# Validated native insert API benchmark

Rows: 10000; process repetitions: 3; host: macOS-26.7.1-arm64-arm-64bit-Mach-O

Fresh fixture per sample; schema/index/preparation, exact readback, drop and Lin JSON IPC excluded. Writes store the same six common fields.
Lin: Rust prepared API; Python peers: DBAPI/DataFrame/driver API. Server timings include round-trip and transfer.
Medians are batch averages, not individual latency percentiles. Each process is aggregated first.

| Case | Engine | Median µs/op | Peer / Lin | Status |

| insert_native | mysql | 175011.334 | 8.23× | validated |
