# Validated native insert API benchmark

Rows: 1000; process repetitions: 1; host: macOS-26.7.1-arm64-arm-64bit-Mach-O

Fresh fixture per sample; schema/index/preparation, exact readback, drop and Lin JSON IPC excluded. Writes store the same six common fields.
Lin: Rust prepared API; Python peers: DBAPI/DataFrame/driver API. Server timings include round-trip and transfer.
Medians are batch averages, not individual latency percentiles. Each process is aggregated first.

| Case | Engine | Median µs/op | Peer / Lin | Status |

| insert_native | lin | 1853.813 | 1.00× | validated |
| insert_native | duckdb | 3535.166 | 1.91× | validated |
